# Wikipedia-Philosophy

This project plays Wikipedia's "Getting to Philosophy" game. It starts on a random Wikipedia article and then it keeps clicking on the first link of whatever page shows up until it gets stuck in a loop or gets to the Philosophy page. It uses beautifulsoup to get links and Selenium to open the pages in Chrome.
